# Mentor Recommendation Engine (Internship Project)
## Overview
Developed a Mentor Recommendation Engine using NLP and machine learning to match mentees with the most suitable mentors based on their skills, experience, and preferences. The system leverages embedding models to compute similarity scores and provide accurate recommendations.

My Contributions
Built a Flask API for generating mentor-mentee embeddings.
Implemented a recommendation algorithm using vector similarity techniques.
Optimized data processing and model inference for faster response times.
Integrated the backend API with a React-based frontend.
Tech Stack
Python, Flask, NumPy, Pandas
NLP & Embeddings (BERT, OpenAI, or custom model)
Vector Similarity Search
React.js (Frontend Integration)
