# Mentor Recommendation Engine (GoCrackIt Internship Project)
## Overview
Developed a Mentor Recommendation Engine using **NLP** and to match mentees with the most suitable mentors based on their searches. The system leverages embedding models to compute similarity scores and provide accurate recommendations.

## My Contributions
Built a **Flask API** for generating mentor embeddings.
Implemented a recommendation algorithm using **vector similarity** technique - **SentenceTransformer**.
Optimized data processing and model inference for faster response times.

## Tech Stack
Python, Flask, NumPy, Pandas
NLP & Embeddings (SentenceTransformer)
Vector Similarity Search
